## 📖 About the Project

**Truth Has a Half Life** is a narrative-driven medieval mystery game
where you assume the role of the High Inquisitor of Vaelor.

The Immortal King lies dying under mysterious circumstances. You must
explore fractured memory chambers, collect weighted evidence, and accuse
the correct culprit before time runs out.

But there is a twist.

No matter how well you perform, the King ultimately dies.

The game challenges the illusion of permanence --- not through
exposition, but through mechanics, symbolism, and consequence. The real
victory is not saving the King, but securing justice and guiding the
kingdom toward acceptance and stability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

-   Explore 6 memory chambers
-   Select up to 3 pieces of evidence
-   Each evidence item has a weight (1, 5, or 10)
-   If total evidence weight ≥ 12, the ritual proceeds
-   Accuse one of three suspects:
    -   Queen Elira
    -   Master Vale (Royal Chef)
    -   Brannic Ashhand (Goblin Groundskeeper)
-   Multiple endings based on accuracy and weight

### Evidence System

Total Evidence Weight:

Total = w₁ + w₂ + w₃

If Total ≥ 12 → Ritual can proceed\
If Total \< 12 → Immediate failure ending

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Core Themes

-   Impermanence
-   Justice vs. Power
-   Truth decay over time
-   The illusion of immortality

The cracked green crystal symbolizes both failed permanence and
necessary acceptance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏆 Endings

-   Failure Ending (Insufficient Evidence)
-   False Judgement Ending (Wrong Accusation)
-   True Justice Ending (Correct Accusation)
-   The Crown of the Mortal King (Final Good Ending)

Even in victory, the King dies --- but the kingdom evolves.
